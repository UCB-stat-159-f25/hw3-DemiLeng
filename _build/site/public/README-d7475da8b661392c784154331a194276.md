# Homework 3 – From Notebooks to Research Packages, Part II

_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._

This project reproduces and analyzes gravitational wave data from the LIGO Open Science Center.  
It includes the full tutorial notebook, custom utility functions, and an automated MyST website build with Binder integration.
